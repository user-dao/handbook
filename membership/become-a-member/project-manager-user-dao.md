# Project Manager User DAO

### About us:

UserDAO is a fully-remote, Web 3 native consultancy operated by a team of US-based professionals with decades of experience helping brands like Uber, Blocks, and adidas design, measure, test and build a better internet.&#x20;

Our goal is to accelerate the adoptions of web3 by connecting with the new breed of business leaders to solve the user problems that plague today’s Web 3 implementations – clumsy design, high cognitive load, and technical complexity. But that’s just, like, our opinion, man.

We also have an office in the metaverse. If that’s your sort of thing.

As a Project Manager working remotely, you will have the opportunity to drive client success for well-known businesses by keeping the wheels securely on the roadway and the seatbelts fastened. In a space where shiny objects can threaten to distract from the task at hand, you will be responsible for making sure complex projects are clarified up-front and completed on time, with a minimal amount of hair-pulling and a maximum amount of high fives.

This means managing the full breadth of the engagement lifecycle for our Web 3 clients (from kickoff to post-mortem), driving milestones, coordinating meetings, securing followups, managing project bandwidth and budget, and generally being a friendly face to clients. If successful, you’ll quickly become their favorite member of our team.
