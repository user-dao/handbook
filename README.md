# Introduction

You can give it a number if you'd like.

Web 3.

Or you can give it a name. The metaverse, blockchain, the decentralized web.

The thing about a technological frontier is, you can never really reach it -- once you're there, it's no longer a frontier.

That's why you set out to do what you do -- to create new frontiers, to unlock new possibilities, to increment the version number on the internet.

It's your job to build. And it's our job to help you.

To help you design better, learn faster, and to help your users make sense of it all, whatever they call it. Introducing UserDAO, a company of friends in an anonymized world.
