Web2 was good at optimizing UX. Each button click was more pageviews, more attention and more ad revenue.&#x20;

Web3 faces a number of challenges.&#x20;

* People are unfamiliar with cryptography and dealing with private keys, pass phrases, and the like&#x20;
* Many interactions happen in browser plugins which are divorced from the rest of the webapp
* If a transaction is complete is often unclear for a long time&#x20;
* There are many low information users of financial products
* There is no customer support to assist or remedy problems
* Transaction are final with no one to help you if you make a mistake.&#x20;
